Steps to run the application

Step 1: git clone
        You will get the three Applications
        1: compatible-device(developed in angular)
        2: micro-fe-react (developed in react)
        3: wrapper (developed in plain JavaScript + HTML)
 Step 2: Got to all three directories (compatible-device, micro-fe-react, wrapper)
        2.1: npm install for all three applications
        2.2: npm start All three Applications
Step 3: Now run below URLS in the browser
        3.1: localhost:4200/main.js
        3.2: localhost:4201/main.js
        3.3: localhost:4202/main.js
Step 4: Parent application running at 4200 port


Important Information: 
1: 4201 port is responsible for the Angular application.
1: 4202 port is responsible for the React application.


Next Target is: We have to add vue application also in this wrapper.

Features: 
1: we can create multiple features with different technology stack(angular, react, vue, Preact, Relay, Elm, Inferno, Ember, Aurellia, Cycle.js) and deploye them on different port.
2: sepratly deployed features as a application can be reused for different applications.
  2.1: e.g: we have created a login feature with simplae JS + HTML because there is no need to add any JS framework and library and reuse that feature in n number od applications.
